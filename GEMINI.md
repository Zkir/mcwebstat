## Development Conventions

The project does not have any formal development conventions documented. However, based on the code, the following conventions can be observed:

*   The Python scripts are located in the root directory.
*   The generated website files are stored in the `_build` directory.
*   The website assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) are located in the `web` directory.
*   Documentation is written in Markdown and stored in the `docs` directory.
*   The project does not have a traditional build process (no compilable files) .
*   After making changes to Python code, please ensure to run `pylint -E *.py` to check for errors.
